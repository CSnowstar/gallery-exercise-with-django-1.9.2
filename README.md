# Image Gallery

It just is a exercise...

Build on django 1.9.2 on Python 2.7.9

## Start

1. Install `PIL(Python Imaging Library)` before you run it.

    [installing-pil-with-pip (stackoverflow)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20060096/installing-pil-with-pip)

> Install Xcode and Xcode Command Line Tools as mentioned. Use Pillow
> instead, as PIL is basically dead. Pillow is a maintained fork of PIL.
> https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/2.2.1
>
> `pip install Pillow`

2. Open cmd.exe

3. Go `manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080`

4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`

    _tips:_ `http://127.0.0.1:8080/gallery` works too.

### Django Administration
